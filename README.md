# Phone Number Beautifier - Firefox Addon

Phone Number Beautifier is a Firefox Addon extension that beautifies phone numbers.

**This add-on injects JavaScript into web pages. The `addons.mozilla.org` domain disallows this operation, so this add-on will not work properly when it's run on pages in the `addons.mozilla.org` domain.**

## Beautifies Phone Numbers

Replaces phone numbers with a beautified variant.  For example, the below phone numbers:

 1. 111.111.1111
 2. 11111111111
 3. 1111111111
 4. +25 1-111-111-1111

Become:

 1. 111-111-1111
 2. 1-111-111-1111
 3. 111-111-1111
 4. 251-111-111-1111
